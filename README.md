Blood Flow Velocity Measurement System

Project Description

This project is focused on measuring and analyzing the blood flow velocity (BFV) in vessels, which is a crucial parameter for evaluating cardiovascular health. The system uses mathematical models and algorithms to estimate blood flow velocity based on user inputs or simulated data.

Key Features:

	•	Blood Flow Velocity Calculation: The system calculates the velocity of blood flow based on various parameters such as vessel diameter and pressure differences.
	•	User Input: Allows users to input values such as blood pressure, vessel radius, and flow resistance to calculate the blood flow velocity.
	•	Real-time Feedback: Provides instant feedback on the calculated blood flow velocity and displays the results in an easy-to-understand format.
	•	Health Insights: Based on the calculated velocity, the system can offer health recommendations, such as identifying abnormal flow conditions that might indicate potential vascular issues.

Technologies Used:

	•	C++ Programming: The project is developed using C++ for the main logic and calculations.
	•	Mathematical Models: Utilizes models like Poiseuille’s Law and Bernoulli’s principle for blood flow calculations in vessels.
	•	File Handling: Optionally, the system can save user inputs and results for future analysis or record-keeping.

How It Works:

	1.	The user inputs parameters related to the vascular system, such as vessel radius, blood pressure, and flow resistance.
	2.	The system applies the relevant mathematical formulas to calculate the velocity of blood flow.
	3.	The result is displayed with additional health insights based on the calculated flow velocity.

Possible Extensions:

	•	Integration with Medical Devices: Future versions could integrate with medical sensors or devices to measure real-time blood flow velocity.
	•	Graphical User Interface (GUI): A GUI could be added for a more user-friendly experience, allowing users to visually represent blood flow velocity.
	•	Advanced Modeling: The system can be enhanced with more sophisticated flow models and simulations based on different types of blood vessels (e.g., arteries, veins).
