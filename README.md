Description

This project provides a computational model to calculate blood flow in a laminar state. The primary goal is to simulate and analyze the behavior of blood flow through arteries under ideal laminar conditions using the principles of fluid dynamics.

Features

	•	Computes blood flow rate in laminar conditions.
	•	Uses Hagen-Poiseuille equation for flow calculations.
	•	Allows input for vessel radius, length, viscosity, and pressure difference.
	•	Provides insights into the effects of various parameters on blood flow.

Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following:
	•	A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang).
	•	Basic understanding of fluid dynamics, especially the Hagen-Poiseuille law.
